## TL;DR

  - Seek to understand the context of the change (what, why, and how).
  - Seek to understand the author’s perspective.
  - Check out the branch and test the changes locally on your own.
  - Consider using the *Conventional Commenting* style to better convey your intent.
  - Try to be thorough in your reviews to reduce the number of iterations.
  - Ensure the author is clear on what is required from them to do.
  - Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and which you don't.
  - Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author has already considered them (ask questions).
  - Look for opportunities to simplify the code and improve its readability.
  - If you don’t understand a piece of code, ask for clarification (other people might have the same question).
  - It can be helpful to post a summary comment after a round of review comments.
