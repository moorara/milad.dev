## Comparison Matrix

|    | Scrum | Kanban |
|----|-------|--------|
| KPI | **Team velocity** | **Cycle-time** |
| Goal | Building highly **reliable** and **predictable** teams. | Building **flexible** and **resilient** teams. |
| Suitable For | **Consistent** and **predictable** workloads.<br/>**Mid-term** and **long-term** Deliverables.<br/> **Multiple teams** at **scale**.  | **Unpredictable** and **arbitrary** workloads.<br/> **Short-term** and **high-priority** deliverables.<br/> **Small** and **independent** teams.
| Cadence | 2-Weeks **Sprints**<br/>3 to 5-Sprints **Milestones** | 1-Week **Beats** |
| Roles | Product Owner (**PO**)<br/>Scrum Master (**SM**)<br/>Development Team | N/A |
| Ceremonies | Planning<br/>Daily Scrums<br/>Review<br/>Demo<br/>Retro<br/>_Scrum of Scrums_ | Daily Stand-ups |
| Board | **Calendar**-like board showing all days in sprint.<br/>Focusing on **deadlines** and **deliverables**. | **Kanban** board showing different stages in work pipeline.<br/> Focusing on **DONE** as quickly as possible. |
| Change of Plan | Current sprint plan CANNOT be changed.<br/>New stories go to backlog for next sprint. | New stories can be added to beat.<br/> Number of work-in-progress (**WIP**) items should be **limited**. |
| Pros | More **predictable** and **reliable**.<br/> Better **scalability**. | **Faster** and more **flexible**. |
| Cons | More management **overhead**.<br/>Less **flexibility** for urgent works. | Less **predictability**.<br/>Hard to **scale**. |

Both Scrum and Kanban require:
  - **Definition of Done** (**DoD**)
  - **Groomed Backlog**
  - Effective **Standups/Scrums**

The goal of planning is:
  - Understading details of what needs to be done.
  - Highlighting **high-priority** and **high-impact** works.
  - Identifying **blockers**, **risks**, and **unknowns**.
  - Determining what can be done in **parallel** and what should be **serialized**.
  - Laying out a plan for **collaboration** between team members.
  - Adopting **reasonable deadlines**.
  - Making **feasible commitments** and communicating **deliverables**.
  - Coming up with a **Plan B**!

When sizing stories in Scrum,
  - Use **Fibonacci** numbers.
  - Think of story size as an **internal** **relative** measure of **complexity** rather than time.
  - Each story should be **small enough** to be done in a sprint.
  - Usually, a story size bigger than 8 is a sign of not enough planning and not identifying **unknowns** and **risks**.

**Scrumban** tries to bring the best of both worlds while making some compromisation on both sides.
In Scrumban, stories are still sized and the key metric is still **team velocity**,
but Scrumban can take in new stories into a sprint as far as another story with similar size is pushed out.
So, the total number of stories planned for the sprint stays the same.
