## TL;DR

  - Microservices are about communicating through APIs!
  - A service mesh defines the **communication interface** between microservices.
  - In an orchestrated environment (Kubernetes), containers talk to each other on top of overlay networking.
  - Service mesh is a central source of truth for **controlling the information flow** between microservices.
  - Mesh enables both the scalability benefits of microservices as well as centralized advantages of monoliths.
  - Service meshes come with built-in observability (**logging**, **metrics**, and **tracing**) for microservices communications.
  - Service meshes have built-in support for resiliency features (_retries_, _timeouts_, deadlines, and _circuit breaking_).
  - They also have capabilities such as _east-west routing_, _access control_, _mTLS_, _smart load balancing_, etc.
  - **Data plane** refers to the layer allowing data to move between microservices and is implemented using _sidecars_.
  - A **sidecar** is an auxiliary container running side-by-side of the main container in your _pod_.
  - Microservices (main containers) communicate to each other through these sidecar containers.
  - Data plane does things like _service discovery_, _routing_, _load balancing_, _health checking_, _authn and authz_.
  - **Control plane** refers to the layer defining communication rules between microservices.
  - Control plane provides configurations and rules for all running data planes in the mesh.
  - Service mesh interface (SMI) defines a standard API for different services meshes, so they can interoperate.
  - [Istio](https://istio.io), [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io), and [Consul](https://www.consul.io) are service meshes adopted widely.
