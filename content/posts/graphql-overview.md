**TL;DR**

  * GraphQL is an **API integration layer** in distributed software (microservices) world.
  * GraphQL is both a **query language** and a **runtime** for executing the queries.
  * GraphQL solves **underfetching** and **overfetching** problems.
  * GraphQL is **strongly typed**.
  * **Caching**, **profiling**, and **rate limiting** are challenging with GraphQL!
  * **Schema stitching** is a technique for _decentralizing_ a GraphQL schema in microservices world.
  * _Schema stitching_ can be done by **convention** or **configuration**.
  * GraphQL schemas can be completely decentralized by **choreography**.
  * A pragmatic approach to enable a GraphQL API is building a _centralized GraphQL gateway_.
