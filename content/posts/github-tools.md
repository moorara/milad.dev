I have been using and evaluating dozens of [GitHub Marketplace Apps](https://github.com/marketplace) for a few months now
for a real-world microservices application built in [Go](https://golang.org).
So, I decided to share what I liked and what I didn't like about these integrations.

The nice thing about using GitHub Marketplace is that your integrations and billing are all consolidated in one place.
As an organization or a billing manager, it is much easier to manage all these different services from a single hub.
