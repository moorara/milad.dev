Recently during an interview, I was asked a question about how much I know about security.
At first, I paused for few seconds because hnestly I didn't know how to answer that question.
Eventually, I answered as developer I am making sure I am doing this, doing that, and following these best practices!
After my interview, I was telling myself that I should know what are the security best practices for developers and engineers.
When I am working on something, I should have a set of principles, guidelines, and considerations on my mind and observe them.
As a result I decided to do a little bit of research and prepare a cheatsheet!
